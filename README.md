## What is Valid8?

Valid8 is an online service that helps you see if your next idea is worth pursuing.

It does this by allowing you to create a landing page with email capture for each idea in minutes. Fill in the details of your idea on Valid8, hit "Publish" and you're ready to share it with the world and get responses. The amount of people that give you their details will tell you whether your idea has legs or not. Once you've got enough people interested in you can start work on the MVP and send it to the list of interested people from Valid8.

## Why are we doing this?
The best practice before building your product or service is to validate it first without investing a lot of time or money - you don't want to spend 6 months building something and then find out no one wants it. Futhermore, before you validate your product **it's even better to validate your idea**. This way you invest even less upfront and find out quickly if your idea has potential. Then you can go on to building that Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

These days, there are many options to build landing pages but they all suppose one thing - that you'll want to build an entire website or e-commerce platform eventually and therefore come with an added cost and complexity in set up. It may take hours or days to set up a landing page with email capture depending on your technical ability.

This is where Valid8 comes in - yest it's a landing page builder but with one purpose - to validate your idea. The flow is simple and requires very little technical ability. Simply fill in the blanks, publish your page and you're ready to go.

**Don't spend more time than you need to on your next big idea until you know it's going somewhere!**
