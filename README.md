## What is Valid8?

Valid8 is a new online service that allows users to create landing pages with email capture for their new ideas in minutes.

### This is how it works:

1. Create a new page for your idea
1. Add a title and description
1. Choose a theme and upload a photo if you wish
1. Hit the "Publish" button and you'll get a unique URL for your idea
1. Share the page with the world via social media, ads etc...
1. Sit tight and see if your idea has potential as people view the page and submit their email adress!

## Why are we doing this?
The best practice before building your product or service is to validate it first without investing too much time or money. **And before you validate your product it's even better to validate your idea**. This way you invest very little time and money and find out quickly if your idea has potential.

Unfortunately the options to build a landing page on the internet these days are cumbersome because they involve using an expensive website builder (probably paying for a lots of features you don't need), configuring an email capture form and setting up the design and layout yourself. This could take hours or days to set up.

Valid8, however, gets **straight to the point**. It is a landing page build with one purpose - to **validate your idea**. It does this by streamlining the page creation process so you can have your page launched in minutes rather than hours. It saves you time so you can focus on the important things.

**Don't spend more time than you need to on your next big idea until you know it's going somewhere!**
