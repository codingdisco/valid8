## What is this?

Valid8 is a new online service that would allow users to create a landing page for their new idea in minutes. It would work like this:
1. Signup
2. Create a new page for your idea
3. Add a title and description
4. Choose a theme and upload a photo if you wish
5. Hit the "Publish" button and you'll get a unique URL for your idea
6. Share the page with the world via social media, ads etc...
7. Each page has an email capture to collect the contact details of your future customers
8. Sit tight and see if your idea has potential!

## Why are we doing this?
The best practice before building your product or service is to validate it first without investing too much time or money. And before you test your product it's even better to validate your idea. This way you invest very little time and money and find out quickly if your idea would sell.

Unfortunately the options to build a landing page on the internet these days quite cumbersome because they involve using a website builder (probably pay for a tonne of features you don't need) and configuring the email capture form, design and layout yourself. This in itself could take hours to complete maybe days if you are not tech-savvy. Valid8, however, gets straight to the point. It's a landing page build with one purpose - to validate your idea. It does this by streamlining the page creation process so you can have your page launched in minutes rather than hours.
