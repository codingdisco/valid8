## What is Valid8?

Valid8 is an online service that allows you to create a landing pages with email capture for your new idea in minutes.

## How it works:

1. Create a new idea in Valid8
1. Add a title and description
1. Choose a theme and upload a photo if you wish
1. Hit "Publish" and you'll get a unique URL for your idea's web page
1. Share the page with the world via social media, ads, anywhere you want
1. Sit tight and see if your idea has potential as people view the page and submit their email addresses

## Why are we doing this?
The best practice before building your product or service is to validate it first without investing a lot of time or money. **And before you validate your product it's even better to validate your idea**. This way you invest even less upfront and find out quickly if your idea has potential. Then you can go on to building that [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).

Unfortunately, these days the options to build a landing page are cumbersome because they involve using an expensive website builder, configuring an email capture form and setting up the design and layout yourself. This could take hours or days to set up.

Valid8, however, gets **straight to the point**. It is a landing page build with one purpose - to **validate your idea**. It does this by streamlining the page creation process so you can have your page launched in minutes rather than hours. It saves you time and money so you can get back to work while Valid8 validates your idea in the background.

**Don't spend more time than you need to on your next big idea until you know it's going somewhere!**
