## What is Valid8?

Valid8 is an online service that helps you see if your next idea is worth pursuing.

### How does it work?

#### ðŸ‘‰ Create

Create a landing page with email capture for each idea in minutes. Fill in the details of your idea, hit "Publish" and you're ready to share it with the world and get responses!

#### ðŸ‘‰ Share

Share the page in social networks and run some ads to bring traffic to it.

#### ðŸ‘‰ Measure
The amount of people that give you their details will tell you whether your idea has potential. Once you've got enough people interested, you can build the MVP and send it to them.

### Why are we doing this?

These days, there are many options to build landing pages but they all suppose one thing:
- That you want to build an entire website or e-commerce platform and, therefore, come with added cost and complexity.

With a traditional site builder it may take hours or days to set up a landing page with email capture depending on your technical ability.

This is where Valid8 comes in. Yes it's a landing page builder but it has one purpose - **to validate your idea**.

The flow is simple and requires very little technical ability: fill in the blanks, publish your page and you're ready to go.

### Validating Valid8
