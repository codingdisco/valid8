### How does it work?

#### ðŸ‘‰ Create

Create a landing page with email capture for each idea in minutes. Fill in the details of your idea, hit "Publish" and you'll get a unique page for your idea.

#### ðŸ‘‰ Share

Share the page in social networks and run ads to bring traffic to it. Viewers can read about the idea and provide their email address if they're interested.

#### ðŸ‘‰ Measure
The amount of people that give you their details will tell you whether your idea has potential. Once you've got enough people interested, you can build the MVP and send it to them.

### Why are we doing this?

These days, there are many options to build landing pages but they all suppose one thing:
> That you want to build an entire website or e-commerce platform and, therefore, come with added cost and complexity.

With a traditional site builder it may take hours or days to set up a landing page with email capture depending on your technical ability. With validate this flow takes minutes: fill in the blanks, publish your page and you're ready to go.
